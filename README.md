# Birds vs Drones Classification App

## Overview

The **Birds vs Drones Classification** app is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images as either **Birds** or **Drones**. By using advanced computer vision techniques, this app can accurately differentiate between birds and drones, offering users a straightforward way to upload images and receive predictions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.
- **Pre-Trained Model**: Employs a pre-trained VGG16 model for precise classification.
- **Custom Aesthetics**: Features a clean, modern design for a better user experience.

## File Structure

- **`app.py`**: The main script for the Streamlit application, which handles user interaction, image processing, and predictions.
- **`BirdvsDrone_vgg16.h5`**: The file containing the pre-trained VGG16 model used for classification.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **`Birds vs Drones_vgg16.ipynb`**: A notebook containing code for the model.
